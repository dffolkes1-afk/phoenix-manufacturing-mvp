Phoenix Print Farm — Market Applications, Materials, Manufacturing & IP

This repository defines the minimum viable manufacturing doctrine for Project Phoenix.
It identifies the industries where sovereign print farms deliver immediate advantage,
the material science requirements for functional production, the manufacturing
pathways used to produce certified parts, and the intellectual property strategy that
protects Phoenix manufacturing systems at scale.

This repository contains no experimental code.
It establishes what may be manufactured, how it is manufactured, and how it is
protected before deployment.

All Phoenix manufacturing implementations must conform to this doctrine.

## Purpose

Phoenix manufacturing is not a factory model.
It is a software-defined production system built on digital inventory,
deterministic output, and localized sovereignty.

This repository locks:

- Market entry priorities
- Material performance requirements
- Approved manufacturing pathways
- Supply chain doctrine
- IP posture for sovereign production

## Supply Chain Doctrine

Phoenix manufacturing does not rely on fragile, centralized global supply chains.
It operates on controlled inputs, localized execution, and deterministic output.

This repository defines the mandatory supply chain doctrine for all Phoenix
print farm and manufacturing deployments.

### Core Supply Chain Principles

**Short-Chain Priority**  
Phoenix systems prioritize local, regional, and sovereign material sources before
global sourcing. Distance is treated as operational risk, not efficiency.

**Digital Inventory First**  
Designs, specifications, tolerances, and certifications exist digitally.
Physical inventory is minimized to prevent capital lock-up and supply shock.

**Material Substitution Readiness**  
Every critical component must have at least one validated alternative material or
manufacturing pathway to avoid single-point failure.

**Vendor Independence**  
No Phoenix manufacturing system may depend on a single vendor, country, or
corporation for critical materials or components.

**Fail-Soft Manufacturing**  
Supply interruptions must degrade production gracefully rather than halt
operations entirely.

### Sovereign Manufacturing Controls

Phoenix supply chains are designed to function under:

- Global shortages
- Trade restrictions
- Logistics disruption
- Energy instability

Supply chain decisions are treated as strategic assets, not cost optimizations.

### Explicit Exclusions

This repository intentionally does not include:

- Vendor identities
- Contracts
- Routes
- Volumes
- Schedules

Operational supply chain execution exists outside public repositories.

This doctrine defines how supply chains must behave,
not how they are executed.
