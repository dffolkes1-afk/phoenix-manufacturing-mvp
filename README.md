This repository defines the minimum viable manufacturing doctrine for Project Phoenix. It identifies the industries where sovereign print farms deliver immediate advantage, the material science requirements for functional production, the manufacturing pathways used to produce certified parts, and the intellectual property strategy that protects Phoenix manufacturing systems at scale.

This repository contains no experimental code.
It establishes what may be manufactured, how it is manufactured, and how it is protected before deployment.

All Phoenix manufacturing implementations must conform to this doctrine.

Purpose

Phoenix manufacturing is not a factory model.
It is a software-defined production system built on digital inventory, deterministic output, and localized sovereignty.
